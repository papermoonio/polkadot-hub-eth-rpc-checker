# Polkadot Hub ETH Health Check

This project contains a set of tests to check the health of Asset Hub Ethereum RPC endpoints using `npm` and `jest`. The tests verify various Ethereum JSON-RPC methods to ensure they return valid and expected responses. 

The health check is automated through GitHub Actions, running both weekly and manually when triggered.
